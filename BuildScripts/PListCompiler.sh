# Takes a file (usually with a suffix of .plistsrc) and "compiles it" using
# the gcc preprocessor.
# The best way to use PlistCompiler is to add a custom build rule to your target
# in Xcode with the following settings:
# Process: "Source files with names matching:" "*.plistsrc"
# using: "Custom script:"
# "Path/to/PlistCompiler/relative/to/${SRCROOT}'
# with output files:
# ${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${UNLOCALIZED_RESOURCES_FOLDER_PATH}/${INPUT_FILE_BASE}.plist
# You can control the include paths by setting the 
# GTM_PLIST_COMPILER_INCLUDE_PATHS environment variable to a colon delimited
# path string. It defaults to "."
