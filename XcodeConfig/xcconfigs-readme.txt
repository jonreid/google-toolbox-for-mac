Configs w/in Project folder are configs expected to be set at the project level.

Configs w/in the Target folder are configs expected to be set on the per target
level.

Configs w/in subconfig are not meant to be used directly; they are referenced by
the other configs.


Remember: when using the configs at any given layer, make sure you set them for
each build configuration.
